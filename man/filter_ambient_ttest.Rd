\usage{
filter_ambient_ttest(
  chemtable,
  sampletable,
  metadata,
  alpha,
  adjust = "none",
  compare = "ambient"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chemtable}{the data frame of the data about the compounds}

\item{sampletable}{the wide data frame with samples in rows and compound names in columns, containing peak areas}

\item{metadata}{the data frame that contains meta data about the group, type, and other attributes of each sample}

\item{alpha}{maximum acceptable p-value, defaults to 0.05}

\item{adjust}{"fdr" for False Discovery Rate correction, "none" for no correction, or any other method of p.adjust}

\item{compare}{the type of sample to compare against - ambient or blank}
}
\description{
This function allows you to filter compounds based on whether the quantity of a compound in ambient or blank samples vs. floral samples is significantly different. It creates a filter_ambient_ttest column with the following values: OK (passed t-test), tTestFail (did not pass t-test), tTestZeros (cannot run t-test, data are all zeros), tTestSmallN (nonzero data but t-test returned NA or NaN). The (adjusted) p-value is added in the ambient_pvalue column.
